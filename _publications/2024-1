This paper introduces **PKRD-COT**, a unified chain-of-thought prompting strategy that enhances reasoning in multi-modal large language models (LLMs) for autonomous driving. By explicitly aligning sensor modalities with structured reasoning steps, Pkrd-cot improves decision-making performance in complex driving scenarios.
