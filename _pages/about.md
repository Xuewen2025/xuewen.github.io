# üëã Hi, I'm Xuewen Luo

I am a **Ph.D. student in Transportation Engineering** at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/) (since Aug 2025), supervised by [Prof. Chenxi Liu](https://chenxiliu-dylan.github.io).  

My research lies at the exciting intersection of **intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving**. I aim to explore how infrastructure intelligence and human-centered AI can make mobility **safer, smarter, and more sustainable**.
